# Python

| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries |    
|---|---|---|---|
| 👩🏻‍💻 Project | Programming | This repo contains the solution to the problem sets in... | - | 
| Project |   Data Wrangling & EDA | I analysed more than 10,000 TMDb movies and getting the answers to - Which actor(s) is associated with higher revenue and profit, Does a higher budget constitute to a higher profit, and Which director produced the highest grossing movie? | pandas, matplotlib |   
| ⛽️ Project | Data Wrangling & EDA | Analysis on vehicles’ fuel economy in 2008 and 2018 to understand usage of alternative sources of fuel, changes in greenhouse gas and smog ratings over the decade, and vehicle features associated with better fuel economy. |  pandas, matplotlib |  
| 🌤 Project | Time-series analysis | In this time-series analysis, I use moving average method to analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends. | pandas, matplotlib |
| 🛍 Project | EDA | Analysis of sales data to find out highest revenue and profit product categories and top customer segments. | pandas, matplotlib, seaborn |
| 🏃🏻‍♀️ Project | EDA | Discovered insights into whether users are using the FitBit app for tracking health habits, their frequency of usage across the week and whether there is correlation between the hours logged, number of steps taken and calories burnt. | pandas, matplotlib, seaborn |
